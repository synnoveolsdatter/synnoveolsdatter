Hi, I’m Synnøve Olsdatter, I know 7 programming languages:
 - Python
 - JS/TS
 - Java
 - C
 - C#
 - Go
 - x86-64 Assembly

Right now, I'm *trying* to learn Rust.

To be honest, a lot of these projects are just here because I wanna see what colour github gives to the different languages I use.

You can reach me at olsdattersynnove@gmail.com.

If I don't respond soon after, I'm not dead, I just don't check my email so often.

Here's my StackOverflow profile: https://stackoverflow.com/users/21604162/synn%c3%b8ve
